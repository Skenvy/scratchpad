# A set of numbers. There are some rules for how they get updated per iteration.
# Calculate how many numbers there are at the end of X iterations. Both problems
# for today are doing the exact same thing, just to different X's. The solution
# for part one is the "naive" approach of just updating the numbers in place.

# Part 2 hits a wall of being resource exhaustive following the naive approach.
# It needs some optimisations. Although the text of the problem statement says
# several times in bold font something about ordering or staying in line, being
# in order is irrelevant to how the numbers evolve each iteration. There's a few
# rules to apply to each number each iteration, but they only act on each number
# individually independent of the surrounding numbers. So, rather than caring
# about order, do away with order; bucket the numbers and act on the buckets!
# Do this by acting on the "amount" of times "number X" appears, rather than
# just on the "number X" done "amount" times.

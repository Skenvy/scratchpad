# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
My silly, unoptimised, solutions to Advent-of-Code, a code challenge advent calendar. I'm not ever going to be fast enough to get on the leaderboard, even if I tried, let alone doing most of the tasks a few days late. But it's still a fun lil game.

See [Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying);
[Eric](https://github.com/topaz) doesn't want people copying the "puzzle text" or "inputs", but solutions are fine.
